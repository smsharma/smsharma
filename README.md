### Hi there üëãüèΩ

I'm currently an IAIFI Fellow at [The NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI)
](https://iaifi.org/), affiliated to MIT's [Center for Theoretical Physics](https://physics.mit.edu/research/labs-centers/center-for-theoretical-physics/). I work at the intersection of particle physics, astrophysics, cosmology, and statistics and am especially interested in developing and using novel statistical techniques to accelerate the search for new physics. A list of my recent publications may be found on [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1394493) or [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/y66hOF7ySaKvYhjCkixRiA).
