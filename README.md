### Hi! 👋🏽

I'm a physicist and machine learning researcher at Anthropic and incoming faculty at BU. 

I work at the intersection of differentiable programming, machine learning, particle physics, and astrophysics and am especially interested in developing and using novel statistical techniques to accelerate the search for new physics. A list of my recent publications may be found on [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/y66hOF7ySaKvYhjCkixRiA) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=hJVjhlwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
