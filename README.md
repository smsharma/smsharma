### Hi there 👋🏽

I'm currently a Postdoctoral Associate at New York University's [Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics](https://cosmo.nyu.edu/). I work at the intersection of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology and am especially interested in developing and using novel statistical techniques to accelerate the search for new physics. A list of my recent publications may be found on [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1394493).
